**Integrating AWS Glue, Lambda, and Airflow:**

1.Use AWS Glue for ETL jobs to transform and move data.    
2.Trigger AWS Lambda functions based on events, such as S3 bucket changes or API Gateway invocations.

3.Use Airflow to orchestrate the entire data pipeline, scheduling the execution of Glue jobs and Lambda functions as needed.
